### 📊 GitHub Statistics

These statistics represent my activity on GitHub. They include the number of contributions I've made, the number of repositories I've created, and the number of followers I have. They also show the number of issues I've opened and the number of pull requests I've made. These numbers are a testament to my commitment to (open source and) my passion for coding.

While numbers don't capture everything, they do paint a part of the picture. Here's my journey by the numbers:

Please note that these numbers do not reflect the entirety of my coding activity. I also contribute to private repositories and work on projects outside of GitHub. So while these numbers provide a glimpse into my coding journey, they are just the tip of the iceberg.

### 🖥️ Languages & Tools

Here's a visual representation of the languages I use in my projects, along with my GitHub activity statistics.

I strive to maintain a balance in my projects, dedicating about 50% of them to one primary language, while the remaining 50% are spread across various other languages. Currently, Python constitutes the majority of my work, but I'm actively working towards increasing my proficiency in C++, despite its steep learning curve, to make it my primary language in the future.

</div>

Why C++, you ask? Well, I have always been fascinated by systems. The way they work, the way they interact, and the way they are built. C and C++ is a language that allows me to dive deep into the system, understand its intricacies, and manipulate it to my will. It's a language that doesn't hold your hand, and I love it for that. It challenges me to think, to solve, and to create. I am a systems thinker, and C++ is a systems language. It's a match made in heaven.

### 📈 GitHub Activity Graph

This graph represents my daily activity on GitHub. It shows the number of days I've been active on GitHub in a row, which is also known as my "streak". The longer the streak, the more consistent I've been in coding. It's a fun and motivating way to track my progress and commitment to coding every day.

### 🎯 Future Goals

As I continue to grow and learn, I have set some goals for myself to achieve in the near future:

🔹 Master the intricacies of C++ and make it my primary language for systems programming.

🔹 Contribute to open-source projects that have a significant impact on the community.

🔹 Explore the field of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning and their interaction with systems programming.

🔹 Improve my problem-solving skills by making problem solving a habit, joining [LeetCode The Hard Way](https://leetcodethehardway.com/) community.

🔹 Collaborate with other developers on projects that solve real-world problems.

These goals keep me motivated and focused on my journey as a software developer. I believe that with consistent effort and a passion for learning, I can achieve these goals and continue to grow as a developer.
