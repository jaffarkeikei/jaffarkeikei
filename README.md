### 🎯 Future Goals

As I continue to grow and learn, I have set some goals for myself to achieve in the near future:

🔹 Make more impact through software.

🔹 Contribute to open-source projects that have a significant impact on the community.

🔹 Explore the field of AI/ML.

🔹 Improve my problem-solving skills by making problem solving a habit, joining [LeetCode The Hard Way](https://leetcodethehardway.com/) community.

🔹 Collaborate with other developers on projects that solve real-world problems.

These goals keep me motivated and focused on my journey as a software developer. I believe that with consistent effort and a passion for learning, I can achieve these goals and continue to grow as a developer.
