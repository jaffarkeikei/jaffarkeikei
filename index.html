								<p>Hi there, my name is Jaffar. I am a second-year student pursuing Computer Science at the University of Toronto, seeking internships for summer 2023.  <br>
									I am an industrious person who will always work hard and focus on completing my duties to the required standards, and excellent team worker and collaborator, and I can easily prioritize tasks to ensure my employer’s goals are always achieved. I am motivated by personal growth and upskilling, always hungry to learn!.</p>

								<h2 class="major">about</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I arrived in Canada in December 2020 as a Permanent Resident from Kenya, joined the University of Toronto in January 2021. 
									The snow was super fun to play around! My passion for Computer Science would make me reduce the fun I had because I 
									desperately wanted to be in the program because my admission category was Life Sciences, not Computer Science 
									(where I never had any prior background).
									Life was a little tough, adjusting to the new environment as well as working under pressure in a super competitive 
									environment was a challenge. I had to zoom out, see what I had on my table, then tried my best to connect the dots. <br> <br>
									Come mid 2022, I got admitted into
									Computer Science!! In my first year, I made 37 internship applications but received no interview for any of them. 
									Following the first three months into my second year at the university, I made 77 applications, and was fortunate to 
									receive one technical interview (with Google!!) which I passed. I accepted the offer and will be joining Google in 
									the summer of 2023. I am looking forward for an exciting summer full of new experiences and endless learning opportunities!
