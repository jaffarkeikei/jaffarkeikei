								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Embracing the frosty landscapes of Canada from Kenya in December 2020, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. The University of Toronto welcomed me in January 2021, a transition marked by snow and novelty, opening a new chapter in my life. <br> <br>

									Guided by a fervent passion for Computer Science, I found myself navigating through an unfamiliar terrain. Despite my admission category being social Sciences and my lack of prior experience in the field, I was unwavering in my resolution to conquer this challenge. <br> <br>
									
									Adjusting to a new environment and managing the pressures of a fiercely competitive academic landscape was undoubtedly a steep learning curve. Nevertheless, I chose to take a step back, assess my situation, and strategically connect the dots, a move that ultimately led to my admission into Computer Science in mid-2022. <br> <br>
									
									Despite the initial setbacks in my first year, where I applied for 37 internships without receiving any interviews, I maintained an optimistic spirit. I redoubled my efforts in my second year, applying for 77 internships and successfully landing a technical interview with Google. <br> <br>
									
									Today, I find myself thriving in the midst of my Google internship, where every day brings a wealth of new experiences and learnings. I am continually learning from industry experts, refining my technical skills, and gaining invaluable insights into the dynamics of the tech industry. <br> <br>
									
									As I look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead, I am more committed than ever to embrace each learning experience and make a lasting impact in the world of technology. I stand today, at the intersection of my passion and an abundance of opportunities, ready to shape the future of technology.
